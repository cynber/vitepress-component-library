# vitepress-components

Collection of reusable Vue components tailored for use in VitePress projects.

This is a work in progress, and a learning experience for me. I'm open to feedback and suggestions. A proper VitePress site with documentation, usage information, and examples is coming soon.

## Test Site

`cd test`

`bash copy-site.sh <name-of-test-site>`

`cd <name-of-test-site>`

`pnpm i`

`npm run docs:dev`

## Usage

After installing the package, you can import the components you need in your VitePress project.
